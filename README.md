## Logistics

### Meeting location
To acommodate conditions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, we have moved our entire event to a virtual conference space managed by [Degy World](https://www.degy.com/degy-world/). The digital space, based on the [VirBela](https://www.virbela.com/) platform, offers an immersive 3D experience that can facilitate interactions similar to those we would have in an in-person event. 

**The platform requires installation of a native application**. All registered participants will recieve instructions on how to download and use the application once registration closes. 

**Poster presenters will receive additional information on how to format their posters** for an optimal experience in our virtual expo hall.  

### Event format
The event will feature **hour-long, parallel paper workshops**, which will be restricted to registered participants. In order to avoid online fatigue, we have distributed workshops across three days, with a morning and an afternoon session on each day. During these sessions, previously circulated manuscipts will be actively discussed, and **no presentation will take place**. It is therefore imperative that **all participants read the papers in advance**, and prepare feedback to ensure a lively and engaging discussion. To enable all participants to engage in productive conversation, **authors are expected to submit complete drafts of their manuscripts no later than November 2, 2020**. Authors will be provided with information on where to upload their manuscripts upon confirmation of acceptance.

The event will also feature **three keynote presentations** on November 17, 18, and 20, as well as a **student poster session** on November 20.  

All talks and sessions will be held in English in our virtual conference site at Degy World.
